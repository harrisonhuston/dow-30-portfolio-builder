# DOW 30 Portfolio Builder

  This project is an interactive financial portfolio builder based on user input from the DOW 30 equity index components. The program allows users to create a 
  hypothetical DOW 30 equity portfolio. It utilizes a step by step format to guide users through its creation. Depending on the user input, the portfolio builder 
  will give users a summary of their hypothetical portfolio, which can include the tickers and shares they bought, the cost for each position, the total cost of their 
  equities, their equity vs cash asset allocation, their equity portfolio's weighted average beta, weighted average p/e ratio, annual forward dividend, annual forward 
  dividend yield, and a sector weighted breakdown of their equity positions. It also includes a summary of their individual equity positions. The program is built with 
  Python and utilizes text files.
